I am a twenty-something STEM graduate, pursuing a Masters Degree in Computer Sciences. I absolutely LOVE solving hard problems and believe in perpetual learning.


## Personal
- I have a great sense of humor :D
- I like to run **alot** !
- I am madly in love with swimming


## Professional
- I have worked as a Software Engineer writing elegant C++ firmware code for embedded IOT devices.


- I am currently working as Software Engineer focusing on Machine Learning and Data Engineering.


- I am familiar with nearly every Machine Learning algorithm/technique out there. There are too many to list so I will mention a few techniques.
    - Regression, Classification, Clustering, Recommender Systems, Deep Learning (CNN, LSTM), Image Segmentation, Object Detection, Reinforcement Learning, Unsupervised Adversarial Learning Methods (CycleGANs).



- My Programming Skills:
    - Python ( Tensorflow, Pytorch, OpenCV, NLTK, Numpy.. )
    - C/C++
    - SQL


## Research
Some of my Masters' research projects:
- Textual Misinformation and User Behaviour Analysis in semi-closed social networks (WhatsApp)
- GenderSwap: Unsupervised Image to Image Translation using Attention Guided Cycle GANS
